I offer a basic instruction.I will first prompt hostname and then will let you enter the command, and the user can put parameters.and provide “exit” command to return to original shell and prevent user use “Ctrl+D” to exit shell accidentally.Also allow user to input a shell script file to program directly.</br></br>
Some difficulties in this homework, I first use fork ( ).Unfortunately, I was wrong to use fork ( ), creating an infinite loop in the fork, then the entire computer resources are exhausted, then malfunction.</br></br>
After resolving fork ( ) issues, I found the parameter sometimes read, sometimes unreadable. After debug, because the parent does not wait ( )...</br></br>
I spend a lot of time, but I learned a lot of process ideas.</br>
