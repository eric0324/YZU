=======
Input number of itration:
Use primitive and interactive solution(Buffon's needle) to solve this problem.

 1. Assuming a two-dimensional plane , from the same line as the d
 2. Randomly generate a needle , the needle length is a, the angle is b,
    position is c
 3. To calculate this needle , falling on a straight line , the number
    of repetitions (assuming n), the number of stars fall on a straight
    line ( assuming m), l is the total length of the needle
 4. Can be calculated , PI can be expressed as ***2l / (d * (m / n))***

Sample usage: ./s1013353_pi.out 10000 2

Sample output: PI=3.09085010657321301863476037397049367427825927734375 (10000 iteration, 0ms, calculate with 2 threads)

(I can't provide 100 digits.Because I don't use huge number , I used '' long double '' type to store.)

 - I can correctness of your calculation (with multiple thread).
 - I makes the number of thread in program is controlable.
 - I  print out the execution time.
 - I have report.
 - I chose a **bad** algorithm , if the thread increases, will drag the execution time
 - Although I don't use huge numbers , but I do not have the correct output(100digits) . So should **not**  additional points....
